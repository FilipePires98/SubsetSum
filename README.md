# SubsetSum
A Study on 'The Subset-Sum Problem'

## Description

The goal of this project is to study different implementations of the solution to the well-known Subset-Sum Problem in terms of computational complexity and execution time.
The implemented solutions are:
- Brute Force
- Branch and Bound 
- Meet in the Middle

The thid implementation presented the best results, with a computational complexity of O(2^(n/2)).
